## Technologies
- FileBeat - FileBeat collects logs from containers and sends them to Logstash
- Logstash - Collects logs from various sources and sends them to ElasticSearch to be indexed
- ElasticSearch - Indexes logs in a storage system and allows them to be queried
- Kibana - Allows the user to query ElasticSearch data and visualize the results
- Amazon S3 - Amazon Web Services Object Storage service

## Features
- Stdout and file log collection from containers with FileBeat
- Amazon S3 Snapshot and Restore
- Data querying
- Data visualization
